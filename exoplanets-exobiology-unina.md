# <u>The Team</u>
<u>We are a small of astrophysicists and future-to-be astronomers at the Physics Department in Naples.</u><br>
The group is led by [Prof. Giovanni Covone](http://giovannicovone.github.io/#about).

##### <u>The team includes:</u>

<u>Luca Cacciapuoti</u>, master student in Physics. He defended his bachelor thesis in 2019, and has contributed to the discovery of six exoplanets in two different systems.<br>
<u>Francesco Gallo</u>, master student in Physics. He will defend his bachelor thesis in October 2020, analyzing atmospheres of Earth-like planets<br>
<u>Riccardo Ienco</u>, master student in Physics. He defended his bachelor thesis in March 2020, with a thesis on exobiology in which he has studied the effect of host-star radiation on the efficiency of oxygenic photosyntesis.<br>

> We are members of the TESS collaboration.
